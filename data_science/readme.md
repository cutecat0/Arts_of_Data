To assess this, you can ask questions like “Do you have a data infrastructure team? <br>
How long have they been around? <br> What is the data stack?  <br>Do you have a data engineering team? <br>
How do they work with data scientists? <br> When you’re building out a new
product, do you have a process for instrumenting the logs, building out the data
tables, and putting them into your data warehouse?”  <br>
If those things aren’t there, you
will be part of the team that is responsible for building that, and you should expect to
be spending quite a lot of time on that. <br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
 The data science skill set varies across people and positions. Although some
knowledge is fundamental, data scientists don’t need to be experts in every relevant field.<br>
 Data science jobs have different areas of focus: putting the right, cleaned data in
front of stakeholders (analytics); putting machine learning models into production (machine learning); and using data to make a decision (decision science).
