IPv6 V.S. IPv4<br>

https://community.fs.com/blog/ipv4-vs-ipv6-whats-the-difference.html ￼ ￼<br>
When it comes to IPv4 vs IPv6 speed, IPv6 is thought to be faster because of the lack of network-address translation (NAT). That's because: Carriers can't provide unique IPv4 addresses to all subscribers (because there simply are not enough left to go around). Web and cloud services provider, Akamai, measured the speed of IPv6 vs. IPv4. They found, “Sites load 5% faster in median and 15% faster for the 95% percentile on IPv6 compared to IPv4.” That means for some people who are pursuing high speed, IPv6 is indeed a better choice.

TCP/IP vs. OSI <br>

When we are talking about layer 2 switches and layer 3 [Ethernet switch](https://www.fs.com/c/ethernet-switches-3079), we are actually referring to the layers of a generic protocol model—Open Source Interconnect (OSI) model. It is a commonly used in describing network communications. The data communications between different networks are not possible if there are no common rules for transmitting and receiving the packets of data. These rules are known as protocols, among which the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) is one of the most widely used. The TCP/IP model is popularly used in network description and is older than OSI model. They both have many layers, what’s the difference between them?

OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes how different software and hardware components involved in a network communication should divide labor and interact with one another. It has seven layers.
